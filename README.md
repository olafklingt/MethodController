# MethodController Quark

A MethodController is a Controller class that links a model to multiple Views or Synths.

The class is a generalization of the CV class from the Conductor and CVCenter Quarks.

The MethodController (and ObjectController) class provides a flexible interface that helps to link values in datastrutures to views, and keep them updated.

Some code is inspired by and sometimes taken from the CV class. In some cases it is simplified. Because I don't use Groups and NodeProxies myself I didn't implemented support for it. But please send me example usecases for which such implementation would be helpful.
