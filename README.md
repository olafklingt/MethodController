# MethodController Quark

A MethodController is a Controller class that links a model to multiple Views or Synths.

The class is a generalization of the CV class from the Conducto and CVCenter Quarks.

The MethodController (and ObjectController) class provides a flexible interface that helps to link values in datastrutures to views, and keep them updated.

Some code is directly taken from the CV class but sometimes simplified. Because I don't use Groups and NodeProxies myself I didn't implemented support for it.
